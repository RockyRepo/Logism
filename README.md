# Logism
Logisim project repository containing digital logic circuits simulated in Logisim: basic gates (AND/OR/NOT/NAND), adders, multiplexers, ALUs, registers, and simple processor design.

This repository contains a digital logic design project built using Logisim, an educational tool for designing and simulating logic circuits. The circuits in this project demonstrate core concepts in digital logic, such as combinational and sequential components, modular design, and hierarchical composition of larger systems.​

The project is organized into .circ files, each representing a different subsystem or testbench, so that individual components can be developed, tested, and reused independently. A top-level circuit integrates these modules into a complete system, which can be simulated directly in Logisim by loading the main project file from the repository.
